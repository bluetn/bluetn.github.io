									<h2>Economic Opportunity</h2>
										<p>We need to prepare our children for the future. We can provide them with the education they need to become healthy, happy members of society. We can expand educational opportunities to our young adults. Together, we can increase access to GED testing centers, apprenticeships, and vocational degrees.</p>
										<p>For our under- and unemployed men and women, John Baker will work to provide real opportunity. By making the area attractive to business, we can build our economy and our citizens.</p>
										<p>For young men and women who need a fresh start, we will work to expand Tennessee HOPE Scholarship funds. Everyone deserves a second chance. John Baker knows the time has come to give our citizens a chance at life and meaningful work.</p>

									<h2>Health Care</h2>
										<p>We have families who too often have to decide between going to the doctor and buying food. When they fall sick, many can’t afford to lose a day at work.</p>
										<p>Many only go to the doctor when the problem or illness becomes an emergency. This places undue burden on our emergency rooms and, as a result, putting a burden on our taxpayers.</p>
										<p>We can give families a healthier future by providing affordable health care options. Too many Tennesseans fall through the cracks, unable to access affordable health care. Too many Tennesseans have little access to affordable preventative care. We have a plan in place. John Baker will push to implement that plan.</p>

									<h2>Affordable Housing</h2>
									<p>Our homeless shelters are overflowing. Too many of our citizens live on the street. It’s time to provide affordable housing opportunities for every man, woman, and child. We have the resources to help homeless individuals and families find a place to call home.</p>
									<p>John Baker serves on the Housing and Community Development Advisory Board (HCDAB). He has worked with Eastern Eight Community Development Corporation and State Building Commission.</p>
									<p>This has provided him with real experience with  expanding affordable housing opportunities in our area. He’s ready to take his experience to Nashville to enact real, lasting change in our community.</p>

									<h2>Addiction</h2>
									<p>Central Appalachia is a beautiful place, but it’s ravaged by an ugly problem: addiction. Despite rampant alcohol and pill abuse, our citizens have little access to real help.</p>
									<p>It’s time to give those suffering from addiction a chance to turn their lives around. Incarcerating addicted men and women costs double what it would cost to rehabilitate them. The burden to pay for incarceration falls on the taxpayers.</p>
									<p>We can turn lives around by providing medical care, education programs, and rehabilitation centers. Together with John Baker, we can build productive, constructive members of our district.</p>

							<h2>About John</h2>
							<p>I made Washington County my home 13 years ago. I was drawn here by the magical energy of its natural beauty and enthusiastic community. People here are bubbling with potential and incredible talent. Men and women pool into this valley from all over East Tennessee and from beyond our state borders.</p>
							<p>There’s just something wonderful about this place that’s hard to put into words. I mean, the natural beauty of East Tennessee is simply stunning. I can drive the same road every day and see different vistas every time. Because the hills and trees seem to have lives of their own. And the people here are hardworking and persistent. From artists and entrepreneurs to eager students and public servants, this is a tight knit community filled with people striving for a better future.</p>
							<p>This is my home because I love the people and I believe in our potential as a community. But to reach that potential we need a legislature that gets the work done. We need a representative who’s willing to address meaningful issues, instead of focusing on divisive policies that do nothing to help the people of Washington County.</p>
							<p>We deserve a representative who works tirelessly to advocate for each and every person in this district, from our chronically underemployed and successful entrepreneurs to our homeless population and college students.

							<p>Washington County is our home and our issues deserve real solutions. I ask you to work with me to bring these real solutions to our home and to our citizens. Thank you.</p>
